 *
 * @param adapter The [StateObjectAdapter] for the state object this animation animating.
 * @param latestAnimatedValue The value that the animation expects the state object to contain at
 * the start of each frame. Should be initially set to the state object's value before the animation
 * and then it will be updated to the animated value on every frame. If the state object's value
 * does not match at the start of a frame, then the animation for that object will be cancelled.
 * @param startTimeNanos The timestamp in nanoseconds of the first frame of this animation. Used
 * with [lastFrameNanos] to calculate play time. When interrupting an ongoing animation, this value
 * should be updated to [lastFrameNanos] so the new animation can start immediately instead of
 * waiting for the next frame.
 * @param lastFrameNanos The timestamp in nanoseconds of the last frame that this animation ran in.
